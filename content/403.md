# Forbidden!

You were denied access to this server. This could be for any one of the below reasons:

- You mistyped the address or tried to access this server from a very old browser that lacks support for [TLS SNI](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-ca/learning/ssl/what-is-sni/). Any browser that is even remotely recent should work fine, but if you are using Internet Explorer 6, you just might want to upgrade.
- You were trying to log in somewhere and your credentials were not valid.
- Your IP address is considered spam by [CrowdSec](https://www.crowdsec.net/) or [DNSBL](https://www.dnsbl.info/).
- [ModSecurity](https://github.com/SpiderLabs/ModSecurity) did not like what you are trying to do. This typically only happens if you are trying to exploit common vulnerabilities on my website.
- You have been banned by [BunkerWeb](https://github.com/bunkerity/bunkerweb). It will automatically ban IP addresses by observing bad behavior.

If none of the above are true, feel free to contact me so I can try to fix the issue for you! Please include:

- Your public IP address (simply Google "what is my ip"),
- the exact page you were trying to open, and
- when you tried to open the page.
